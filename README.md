## Abstract
Unwanted external noise sources can be detrimental to sleeping patterns. There are significant negative health effects associated with insufficient sleep, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. There are many noise cancellation techniques available, but they require uncomfortable equipment such as earbuds or headphones which introduces further sleeping difficulty. The objective of this project is to attenuate the loudest frequency sound in a localized region near the ear. The system takes in environmental noise and successively attenuates it by outputting a destructively interfering audio signal generated through adaptive signal processing. The necessary waves are determined using wave and control theory. The benefit of this project over existing alternatives is in its comfortable and simple design. The system does not require complicated installations when compared to acoustic insulation. There is no longer a requirement for uncomfortable equipment such as noise canceling headphones or earbuds. The system prevents ear health issues associated with wearing some existing alternatives.
